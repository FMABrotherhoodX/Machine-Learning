Follow these steps to run a Jupyter Notebook on your computer:
Prerequisites:
    Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.
    Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    pip install notebook
    (If you're using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook is already included.)
Steps to Run the Notebook:
    Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
        On Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
        On macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal application.
    Navigate to the Notebook Directory:
        Use the cd command to move to the folder where your Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) is located. For example:
            cd path/to/your/notebook
    Launch Jupyter Notebook:
        Run the following command:
            jupyter notebook
        This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.
    Open Your Notebook:
        In the browser, you will see a list of files in the directory. Click on your .ipynb file to open it.
    Run the Notebook:        
        Select each cell and run it by pressing Shift + Enter or by clicking the "Run" button at the top.
        Follow the instructions or execute the code blocks in the notebook.
